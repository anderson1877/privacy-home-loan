## 🔗 Smart Contract: Privacy-First Architecture

Our `PrivacyHomeLoan.sol` contract revolutionizes mortgage lending with **FHE-encrypted data processing**:

### 🔐 Core Privacy Features
- **Encrypted Data Storage**: All sensitive information (income, credit scores, property values) stored as encrypted data on-chain
- **Zero-Knowledge Verification**: Verify loan eligibility without exposing personal financial details
- **Homomorphic Risk Assessment**: Calculate risk scores while keeping data encrypted
- **Private Payment Processing**: Track payments without revealing amounts

### 🚀 Key Contract Functions

| Function | Purpose | Privacy Level |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| `createLoanApplication()` | Submit FHE-encrypted loan data | 🔒 Fully Encrypted |
| `assessRisk()` | Calculate risk scores on encrypted data | 🔒 Homomorphic Processing |
| `approveLoan()` | Approve/reject without data exposure | 🔒 Zero-Knowledge |
| `makePayment()` | Process encrypted payment amounts | 🔒 Private Transactions |

### 💡 How It Works
